# Navigation of code

{ #dev-architecture-code-navigation }

**Stable ID:** `ARCH-CODE-NAVIGATION`

## Ancestors and descendants

If node A contains node B in the AST at any depth — including when A and B are the same node —
then A is an **ancestor** of B and B is a **descendant** of A.

We use the terms *proper ancestor* and *proper descendant* to exclude the node itself.

### Navigation Functionality

* AST structure
  * Parent & Ancestors
  * Children & Descendants
  * Siblings
* Usage
  * definition / (forward) declaration - references (ONLY in current file / analysis unit)
* Inheritance
  * Base - Derived classes

## Shared and adapter navigation

`NodeProtocol` guarantees child traversal, so generic algorithms can navigate
descendants. `ASTRewriter` requires `Rewritable.parent` for the upward
navigation needed to order and apply edits. Adapters may provide further
navigation helpers, such as `root`, `next_sibling`, and `preceding_sibling`,
for recipes that need them. Their implementation remains adapter-owned.
